# Microsoft Graph

TBD
## Microsoft Graph Core Libraries

- Microsoft Graph Core libraries will need to implement the Kiota Abstractions

## What's different from existing Graph SDKs

- Removed the need for calling Request() to transition from path building to call a method.
- Set query parameters using parameter object instead of fluent API
